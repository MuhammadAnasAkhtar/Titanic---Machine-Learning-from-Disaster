The "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" project is a classic data science challenge where participants use machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. 
The dataset includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and fare, which can be used to build predictive models.
The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on these features. 
This project is an excellent opportunity to practice data cleaning, feature engineering, and model tuning using various machine learning algorithms.
